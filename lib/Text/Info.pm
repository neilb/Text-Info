=head1 NAME

Text::Info - Retrieve information about, and do analysis on, text.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01.

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Text::Info;

    my $text = Text::Info->new( "Some text..." );

    say "The text is written in language '" . $text->language . "', and";
    say "has a readability score (FRES) of " . $text->readability->fres;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Text::Info> is an extensible and easy to use solution for retrieving useful
information about texts based on the L<Germanic languages|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages>.

The solution is under heavy development, has a limited feature set for the
time being, and its API will definitely change. Please respect these facts
if you intend to use it.

Contributions are welcome!

=head1 WARNING!

This solution is - and will be - heavily based on language-specific features.
This means that if you use this solution on languages that doesn't have the
required "support modules", you're on your own. For the time being this only
affects the L<Text::Info::Readability> functionality, but will in the future
also include stemming- and stop word-functionality (and probably many other
things).

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new()

Returns a new L<Text::Info> object. Can take C<text> as a single argument,
optionally C<tld> (top level domain, for better language detection), and/or
optionally C<language> if you want to specify the text's language yourself.

    my $text = Text::Info->new( 'Dette er en norsk tekst.' );

    # ...or...

    my $text = Text::Info->new(
        text => 'Dette er en norsk tekst.',
        tld  => 'no',
    );

    # ...or...

    my $text = Text::Info->new(
        text     => 'Dette er en norsk tekst.'
        language => 'no',
    );

It really doesn't make sense to set both C<tld> and C<language>, as the
former is a helper for detecting the correct language of the text, while
the latter overrides whatever that detection algorithm returns.

=item readability()

Returns an instance of the text's L<Text::Info::Readability> class, which in turn
can be used to retrieve L<readability information|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability_test> about the text in question.

=cut

has 'readability' => ( isa => 'Text::Info::Readability', is => 'ro', lazy_build => 1 );

sub _build_readability {
    my $self = shift;

    return Text::Info::Readability->new(
        text     => $self->text,
        tld      => $self->tld,
        language => $self->language,
    );
}

=item sentences()

Returns an array reference of the text's sentences as C<Text::Info::Sentence>
objects. This method is derived from L<Text::Info::BASE>.

Keep in mind that this method tries to remove any separators, so the sentences
returned should NOT contain those. For example "This is a sentence!" will be
returned as "This is a sentence".

=item sentence_count()

Returns the number of sentences in the text. This method is derived from
L<Text::Info::BASE>.

=item avg_sentence_length()

Returns the average length of the sentences in the text. This method is derived
from L<Text::Info::BASE>.

=item words()

Returns an array reference containing the text's words. This method is derived
from L<Text::Info::BASE>.

=item word_count()

Returns the number of words in the text. This is a helper method and is derived
from L<Text::Info::BASE>.

=item avg_word_length()

Returns the average length of the words in the text. This is a helper method and
is derived from L<Text::Info::BASE>.

=item ngrams( $size )

Returns an array reference containing the text's ngrams of size C<$size>.
Default size is 2 (i.e. bigrams). This method overrides L<Text::Info::BASE>'s
C<ngrams()> method, as it takes into accounts building ngrams based on the
text's sentences, not the text's complete list of words.

=cut

override 'ngrams' => sub {
    my $self = shift;

    my @ngrams = ();

    foreach my $sentence ( @{$self->sentences} ) {
        foreach my $ngram ( @{$sentence->ngrams(@_)} ) {
            push( @ngrams, $ngram );
        }
    }

    return \@ngrams;
};

=item unigrams()

Returns an array reference containing the text's unigrams, i.e. the same
as C<ngrams(1)>. This is a helper method and is derived from L<Text::Info::BASE>.

=item bigrams()

Returns an array reference containing the text's bigrams, i.e. the same
as C<ngrams(2)>. This is a helper method and is derived from L<Text::Info::BASE>.

=item trigrams()

Returns an array reference containing the text's trigrams, i.e. the same
as C<ngrams(3)>. This is a helper method and is derived from L<Text::Info::BASE>.

=item quadgrams()

Returns an array reference containing the text's quadgrams, i.e. the same
as C<ngrams(4)>. This is a helper method and is derived from L<Text::Info::BASE>.

=item syllable_count()

Returns the number of syllables in the text. This method requires that
Lingua::__::Syllable is available for the language in question. This method
is derived from L<Text::Info::BASE>.
