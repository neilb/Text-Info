=over

=item fres()

Returns the text's "Flesch reading ease score" (FRES), a text readability score.
See L<Flesch–Kincaid readability tests|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests> on Wikipedia for more information.

Returns undef is it's impossible to calculate the score, for example if the
there is no text, no sentences that could be detected etc.

has 'fres' => ( isa => 'Maybe[Num]', is => 'ro', lazy_build => 1 );

sub _build_fres {
    my $self = shift;

    return undef if ( $self->text           eq '' );
    return undef if ( $self->sentence_count == 0  );
    return undef if ( $self->word_count     == 0  );

    my $words_per_sentence = $self->word_count / $self->sentence_count;
    my $syllables_per_word = $self->syllable_count / $self->word_count;

    my $score = 206.835 - ( ($words_per_sentence * 1.015) + ($syllables_per_word * 84.6) );

    return sprintf( '%.2f', $score );
}
