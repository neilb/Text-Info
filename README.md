# NAME

Text::Info - Retrieve information about, and do analysis on, text.

# VERSION

Version 0.01.

# SYNOPSIS

    use Text::Info;

    my $text = Text::Info->new( "Some text..." );

    say "The text is written in language '" . $text->language . "', and";
    say "has a readability score (FRES) of " . $text->readability->fres;

# DESCRIPTION

[Text::Info](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Info) is an extensible and easy to use solution for retrieving useful
information about texts based on the [Germanic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages).

The solution is under heavy development, has a limited feature set for the
time being, and its API will definitely change. Please respect these facts
if you intend to use it.

Contributions are welcome!

# WARNING!

This solution is - and will be - heavily based on language-specific features.
This means that if you use this solution on languages that doesn't have the
required "support modules", you're on your own. For the time being this only
affects the [Text::Info::Readability](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Info::Readability) functionality, but will in the future
also include stemming- and stop word-functionality (and probably many other
things).

What you can do to help on this, is to create the missing supported modules,
for example create a Lingua::\_\_::Syllable module specific for your language.

# METHODS

- new()

    Returns a new [Text::Info](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Info) object. Can take `text` as a single argument,
    optionally `tld` (top level domain, for better language detection), and/or
    optionally `language` if you want to specify the text's language yourself.

        my $text = Text::Info->new( 'Dette er en norsk tekst.' );

        # ...or...

        my $text = Text::Info->new(
            text => 'Dette er en norsk tekst.',
            tld  => 'no',
        );

        # ...or...

        my $text = Text::Info->new(
            text     => 'Dette er en norsk tekst.'
            language => 'no',
        );

    It really doesn't make sense to set both `tld` and `language`, as the
    former is a helper for detecting the correct language of the text, while
    the latter overrides whatever that detection algorithm returns.

- readability()

    Returns an instance of the text's [Text::Info::Readability](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Info::Readability) class, which in turn
    can be used to retrieve [readability information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability_test) about the text in question.

- sentences()

    Returns an array reference of the text's sentences as `Text::Info::Sentence`
    objects. This method is derived from [Text::Info::BASE](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Info::BASE).

    Keep in mind that this method tries to remove any separators, so the sentences
    returned should NOT contain those. For example "This is a sentence!" will be
    returned as "This is a sentence".

- sentence\_count()

    Returns the number of sentences in the text. This method is derived from
    [Text::Info::BASE](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Info::BASE).

- avg\_sentence\_length()

    Returns the average length of the sentences in the text. This method is derived
    from [Text::Info::BASE](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Info::BASE).

- words()

    Returns an array reference containing the text's words. This method is derived
    from [Text::Info::BASE](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Info::BASE).

- word\_count()

    Returns the number of words in the text. This is a helper method and is derived
    from [Text::Info::BASE](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Info::BASE).

- avg\_word\_length()

    Returns the average length of the words in the text. This is a helper method and
    is derived from [Text::Info::BASE](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Info::BASE).

- ngrams( $size )

    Returns an array reference containing the text's ngrams of size `$size`.
    Default size is 2 (i.e. bigrams). This method overrides [Text::Info::BASE](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Info::BASE)'s
    `ngrams()` method, as it takes into accounts building ngrams based on the
    text's sentences, not the text's complete list of words.

- unigrams()

    Returns an array reference containing the text's unigrams, i.e. the same
    as `ngrams(1)`. This is a helper method and is derived from [Text::Info::BASE](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Info::BASE).

- bigrams()

    Returns an array reference containing the text's bigrams, i.e. the same
    as `ngrams(2)`. This is a helper method and is derived from [Text::Info::BASE](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Info::BASE).

- trigrams()

    Returns an array reference containing the text's trigrams, i.e. the same
    as `ngrams(3)`. This is a helper method and is derived from [Text::Info::BASE](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Info::BASE).

- quadgrams()

    Returns an array reference containing the text's quadgrams, i.e. the same
    as `ngrams(4)`. This is a helper method and is derived from [Text::Info::BASE](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Info::BASE).

- syllable\_count()

    Returns the number of syllables in the text. This method requires that
    Lingua::\_\_::Syllable is available for the language in question. This method
    is derived from [Text::Info::BASE](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Info::BASE).
